# Phase 7.17 deployment record

## Scope

This deployment contains the balanced student dashboard cards, time-of-day
greeting, near-term lesson launch notice, home-learning panel, secured
lesson-scoped student submission route, logout-session repair and compact
Learn header branding. It also uses outlined Resources and Notifications
navigation icons when unselected, with filled selected states, and the compact
two-row footer layout. Student dashboard calendar and resource actions are
full-width and aligned to the panel copy. The student dashboard now also
keeps a viewport-height minimum so the footer sits at the browser bottom when
the content is short and normal scrolling takes over when it is long.
The submission flow reuses the existing private resource/R2 pipeline and
the logout repair does not change billing or provider behavior.
Shared content spacing now aligns every page title with the top of the first
sidebar navigation button, including the student dashboard greeting.

## Required validation

```text
npm test
npm run build
npm run check:legal
npx wrangler deploy --dry-run --config wrangler.jsonc
```

The final deployed revision and Worker version are recorded below after the
production deployment completes.

## Acceptance boundary

Authenticated Chromium should verify:

- the next and last lesson cards;
- the time-of-day greeting and pupil first-name fallback;
- equal card widths across both dashboard rows;
- the red under-30-minute notice with and without a lesson URL;
- the home-learning task and `None available` state;
- the `Submit here` navigation;
- a successful student upload;
- student ownership isolation for another student's lesson submission URL.
- the logout POST, signed-out landing page and explicit resume link.
- the reduced centered Learn mark and contracted header bar at desktop and
  mobile widths.

No Production invoice, payment, Direct Debit, credit note, bank transaction or
£1 test is part of this feature.

- Worker: `foxtutor-learn`
- Worker version: `447efda8-cf98-42f4-b76b-f6e8b66ee87f`
- Routes: `foxtutor.org/learn` and `foxtutor.org/learn/*`
- Deployment completed on 2026-09-15. The unauthenticated endpoint smoke test
  correctly reached the Cloudflare Access login boundary. Authenticated
  Chromium logout acceptance remains a human-session check.
